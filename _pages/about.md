Hi there! My name is Hamza and I am a Data Science major at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

I am a Research Assistant in Professor [Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/)'s Visual Intelligence lab at Northeastern University. Additionally, I have experience mentoring students as a Teaching Assistant for the [Fundamentals of Computer Science](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500/) course at Northeastern University. If you are interested in learning more about my work or have any interesting potential opportunities available, feel free to reach out!
