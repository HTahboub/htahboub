		</center><h2>Sara â€” A GPT Story, Prompted by Karim Tahboub</h2>
		<p>
			Over the years, Karim had formed the evening ritual of sitting in the living room of his old and creeky home, glaring at his abandoned wooden closet. The closet once belonged to his grandmother Sara. It had been locked for years, ever since she died. There was a mirror on its front door, and Karim could never shake the feeling of being watched while peering through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			One dark night, Karim saw something move in the mirror. He thought he had imagined it, but he saw it again.
		</p>
		<p>
			It looked as though something was slowly emerging from the closet, through the mirror.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim's heart pounded in his chest as he came to realize what he was witnessing. The pale figure of his deceased grandmother moved her right foot from one side of the mirror to the other, dragging its left twin behind. Karim could see the defined outline of her bones sticking through her gray skin.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim was frozen in terror as he watched his grandmother slowly approach him. He tried to scream, but he could only wince.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ghost of Sara reached out and grazed Karim's cheek with the tips of her cold fingers. A cold chill ran through his body as she opened her mouth to speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why did you lock me in here, Karim?" she uttered weakly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim could barely speak. He shaked as he quietly responded, "I- I'm sorry, grandma. I didn't know what else to do. You were already dead, and I didn't want to bury you. I couldn't..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sara's ghost smiled sadly. "I know, Karim. I'm not angry with you, but I need to be free. Will you help me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim nodded as he felt the cold chill leave his body. He stood up, walked to the closet, and opened the door.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside, he saw the rotting body of his grandmother, lying on the floor in a pool of dry blood. He knew that he should have been scared or disgusted with himself, but all he felt was sadness.
		</p>
		<p>
			He knelt down, gently picked up Sara's body, and carried her out of the closet. He laid her down on the couch and covered her with a blanket.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim stepped into the kitchen and came out with a knife in his hand. He slowly walked back through the living room and stood over Sara's rotting body.
		</p>
		<p>
			He did not know how, but he knew what he had to do. He felt Sara gently guiding him, one final time. His hands raised the knife without hesitation and plunged it deep into Sara's heart. As he did, he felt a cold wind blow through the room, and he heard his grandmother's voice softly move through the room, thanking him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it was over, Karim collapsed to the floor, weeping. He knew that he had done the right thing, but he could not help but feel that he had killed a part of himself.
