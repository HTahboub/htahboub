		</center><h2>Sara â€” A GPT Story, Prompted by Karim Tahboub</h2>
		<p>
			Karim was sitting in the living room of his old house, staring at the abandoned wooden closet. It had been locked for years, ever since his grandmother Sara had died. There was a mirror on its front door, and Karim couldn't help but feel like it was watching him.
		</p>
		<p>
			One dark night, Karim was sitting in the living room, staring at the closet, when he saw something move in the mirror. At first, he thought it was his imagination, but he saw it again.
		</p>
		<p>
			It looked like someone was slowly emerging from the closet through the mirror.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim's heart started pounding in his chest as he realized what he was seeing. He was seeing a ghost, the ghost of his deceased grandmother Sara.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim was frozen in terror as he watched his grandmother slowly approach him. He tried to scream, but no sound would come out.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ghost of Sara reached out and grazed Karim's cheek with the tips of her cold fingers. He felt a cold chill run through his body. Then, she spoke.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why did you lock me in here, Karim? I've been trying to reach you for years."
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim could barely speak, but he managed to croak out a response. "I- I'm sorry, grandma. I didn't know what else to do. You were already dead, and I didn't want to bury you. I couldn't..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sara's ghost smiled sadly. "I know, Karim. I'm not angry with you. I just want to be free. Will you help me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim nodded, and he felt the cold chill leave his body. He stood up, walked to the closet, and opened the door.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside, he saw his grandmother's body, lying on the floor in a pool of dry blood. He knew that he should have been disgusted or scared, but all he felt was sadness.
		</p>
		<p>
			He knelt down and gently picked up Sara's body and carried her out of the closet. He laid her down on the couch, and he covered her with a blanket.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karim stepped into the kitchen and came out with a knife in his hand. He walked back through the living room and stood over Sara's rotting body.
		</p>
		<p>
			He did not know how, but he knew what he had to do. It was as if Sara was guiding him for one final time. He felt his hands raise the knife and plunge it deep into Sara's heart.
		</p>
		<p>
			As he did, he felt a cold wind blow through the room, and he heard his grandmother's voice thank him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it was over, Karim collapsed to the floor, weeping. He knew that he had done the right thing, but he couldn't help but feel like he had just killed a part of himself.
